# Shape Factory Demo

This Java project, **Shape Factory Demo**, showcases the implementation of basic Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles through a shape factory simulation. It demonstrates concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and composition by modeling geometric shapes and a canvas that contains them.

## Project Overview

The Shape Factory Demo consists of several Java classes representing different geometric shapes and a canvas that holds a collection of these shapes. The project illustrates the following OOP concepts:

- **Inheritance and Polymorphism:** Through classes like `CRectangle`, `CSquare`, `COval`, and `CCircle`.
- **Abstraction:** Utilizing the abstract class `CShape` to define a general form for other shapes.
- **Composition:** The `CCanvas` class contains a list of shapes, demonstrating a "has-a" relationship.
